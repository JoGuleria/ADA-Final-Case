# ADA-Final-Case
# Comparative Evaluation of Training Programs Using Experimental Design

This project assesses the effectiveness of three employee training programsâ€”Program A, Program B, and the Current Programâ€”across six regional offices at NLS. The goal was to determine which program led to the most improvement in employee application and proficiency scores.

## ðŸ“Š Objective
Evaluate training impact using experimental design and regression analysis to:
- Measure employee improvement pre- and post-training
- Isolate the effect of each program using Difference-in-Differences modeling

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Design

| Group         | Program         | Offices              |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Control       | Current Program  | New York, Los Angeles |
| Treatment A   | Program A        | Miami, Houston        |
| Treatment B   | Program B        | Detroit, Denver       |

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Overview

- Calculated improvement in **proficiency** and **application** scores
- Created dummy variables to encode program groups
- Applied **OLS regression** to evaluate score improvements across training groups
- Used a Difference-in-Differences
